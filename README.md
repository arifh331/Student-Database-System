# Student-Database-System
A simple Student Database System produced through user inputs 

The program works through user-inputs on the console. The program will prompt the user on specifics of the class, such as its size , 
names of students and more pieces of information. 

The program will check to make sure appropriate piecees of information is entered or there will be an error with the user being reprompted.

This is simply a display of Objective - Oriented Programming Principles and other basic Java Principles such as Boolean Logic, Exception 
Handling etc to show how easily a database system can be created. 

Give it a shot!
